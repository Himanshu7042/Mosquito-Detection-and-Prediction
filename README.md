# Mosquito-Detection-and-Prediction
This just for storage or sharing purpose not for active development
## Overview  
This project implements a YOLO-based deep learning model to detect and localize mosquito species in images. The model helps in identifying different mosquito species, which can be useful for research, disease prevention, and monitoring.  

## Features  
- Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection  
- Detects and localizes mosquito species in images  
- Provides bounding box predictions for accurate identification  
- Can be trained on custom datasets for improved accuracy  

## Dataset  
The model requires a labeled dataset of mosquito images, including species annotations and bounding box coordinates. The dataset can be in YOLO format or converted accordingly.  

## Dependencies  
Ensure you have the required libraries installed before running the notebook
